        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          I am a front‑end developer and researcher committed to creating
          inclusive digital experiences. My academic training in computer
          science has given me a strong foundation in software engineering and
          user‑centred design. Over the years I have taught web development
          courses, worked on collaborative research projects, and consulted for
          organisations seeking to improve their digital accessibility. When I
          design and build websites, I strive to use semantic HTML and
          progressive enhancement so that everyone can access the content,
          regardless of their device or assistive technology.

      <!-- Goals Section -->

        <h2>Goals in this Programme</h2>
        <p>
          My primary objective in participating in this program is to refine my
          proficiency with modern front‑end frameworks while preserving a focus
          on accessible and maintainable code. Specifically, I aim to
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>deeply understand responsive design patterns and how they can be applied without relying on heavy frameworks,</li>
          <li>develop robust client‑side validation techniques that complement server‑side checks, ensuring that forms are inclusive and user friendly,</li>
          <li>explore emerging CSS features such as container queries to make layouts more adaptable, and</li>
          <li>contribute to the broader conversation on digital accessibility through research and teaching.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Confidence Section -->
      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          Despite my experience, there remain areas where I seek to grow. I
          occasionally struggle with intricate animations and transitions,
          particularly when balancing performance with visual richness. In
          addition, while I understand the fundamentals of progressive web apps
          (PWAs), I am less confident in implementing service workers and
          offline caching strategies. Part of my professional development plan
          involves dedicating time to master these concepts so that I can build
          applications that are both engaging and resilient. Recognising gaps
          in one’s knowledge is the first step toward addressing them.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          As you continue your journey, remember that technology evolves
          rapidly but the fundamentals remain constant. Prioritise clear
          semantics and accessibility from the outset of every project. Do not
          let the allure of new libraries distract you from the core principles
          of web development: clean markup, readable stylesheets, and
          unobtrusive scripts. Keep a research journal to document challenges
          and breakthroughs; future you will appreciate the record of growth.

      <!-- Extra Thoughts Section -->
      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Participating in this stage of the program has reinforced my belief
          that accessible design is not an afterthought but a core requirement of
          professional web development. Building a contact form that validates
          input while communicating errors through ARIA attributes illustrates
          how thoughtful engineering can make a profound difference to users.
          The process also served as a reminder that responsive design is
          achieved through careful consideration of layout, typography, and
          spacing rather than a collection of device‑specific breakpoints.
